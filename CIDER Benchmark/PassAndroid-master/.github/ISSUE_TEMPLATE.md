# Creating a issue

Thanks for your feedback - this is really important to improve the project!
Please make issues atomar and closeable. This means if you have one idea for an enhancement and experience a bug - please submit 2 issues and don't pack it all in one.
Please try to give a lot of detail - so ideally the issue can be reproduced. At the very minimum it is important to know what version of the app and what version of android you are using and where you got the app from.
