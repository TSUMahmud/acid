# Contributing Guidelines

You are very welcome to submit PullRequests and Issues. Please keep the PullRequests small if not otherwise possible. Contact me *before* you are creating a big PR to avoid unnecessary work and rebasing of big PRs.

If you have a question please ask the [community](https://plus.google.com/communities/116353894782342292067).
