# PullRequest

Great that you are thinking about submitting a PullRequest!

Please keep them small if not otherwise possible. Contact me *before* you are creating a big PR to avoid unnecessary work and rebasing of big PRs. Also try to add tests - I am not dogmatic about that but prefer PRs backed by tests. This project has everything setup for Espresso UI and Unit-tests. Also the existing unit and UI-tests muss pass before submitting a PullRequest.

Please base the PullRequests on the branch named dev if one currently exists - otherwise use master
