# PassAndroid

Android App to view Passes (e.g. event tickets, coupons, loyalty cards, boarding passes, ...)

![Screenshots](https://ligi.de/img/passandroid_screenshots.png)

Displays [esPass](https://espass.it) (`*.esPass`) & Passbook (`*.pkpass`) files, shows the Barcode (QR, PDF417, AZTEC, Code 39 and Code 128 format) and is also usable offline.

When preparing for the Chaos Communication Congress 2012 #29c3 I stumbled upon a passbook file for the first time.
I really like the idea of paperless tickets as it saves time and trees which are both very valuable to me.
The problem was that I was unable to find an app to open and use the downloaded passbook files with, that's why I wrote my own one.
